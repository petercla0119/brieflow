"""Streaming final merge — attach the full CP phenotype feature table to the
deduplicated merge via a memory-bounded polars left join.

Both callers wrap this one function so the two paths can never drift:
  - Snakemake:    workflow/scripts/merge/final_merge.py
  - Direct runner: scripts/direct/run_merge_direct.py :: step_final_merge

Why not a plain pandas .merge: phenotype_cp is ~3,600 cols x ~1M rows; a pandas
full-load merge (or a wide batched merge) materializes it several times over and
OOM-kills even a 64 GB box. polars scan_parquet -> left join -> sink_parquet
streams it out-of-core and multithreaded, working set bounded.
