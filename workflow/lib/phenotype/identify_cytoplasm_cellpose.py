    # Vectorized replacement for the former per-label Python loop.
    #
    # The old loop iterated every cell label L in ascending order and, for each,
    # wrote L over `cells == L` then zeroed `nuclei == L`. Because iterations ran
    # in ascending label order and each overwrote the previous, the net per-pixel
    # result was: keep the cell label C, UNLESS a nucleus label N (>0) with N >= C
    # covers the pixel. (Its own nucleus, N == C, zeros it within the same pass; a
    # larger-labelled nucleus, N > C, is processed later and also zeros it. A
    # smaller-labelled nucleus, N < C, is overwritten by the later cell-C pass and
    # therefore left as C — a label-order quirk, preserved here for output parity.)
    #
    # `(nuclei > 0) & (nuclei >= cells)` reproduces that mask exactly in a single
    # pass, eliminating the O(N_cells * N_pixels) `np.argwhere` loop (~119 s/tile
    # -> milliseconds). Bit-identity is proven on synthetic masks in
    # test_identify_cytoplasm_cellpose.py and verified on real plate-4 tiles in
    # equivalence_identify_cytoplasm.py.
    #
    # ponytail: relies on nuclei/cells sharing the same label set (true for
    # matched cellpose masks, which reconcile_nuclei_cells relabels to a common
    # label set). This precondition is now ENFORCED by the set-equality gate
    # above — no longer a weak proxy: if a nucleus label ever existed that is
    # absent from `cells`, the old loop never zeroed it while this expression
    # would, so the gate returns None first and this line never runs on such
    # input. The ascending-label semantics (keep C unless a nucleus N >= C
    # covers the pixel) hold only under that shared-label-set precondition.
