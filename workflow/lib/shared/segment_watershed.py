"""Watershed-based Image Segmentation!

This module provides functions for segmenting microscopy images using the Watershed algorithm
(relating to SBS base calling and phenotyping -- steps 1 and 2). It includes functions for:

1. Cell and Nuclei Segmentation: Segmenting cells and nuclei from various image types.
2. Image Preprocessing: Applying filtering and preprocessing techniques to images.
3. Label Reconciliation: Reconciling nuclei and cell labels based on their spatial relationships.
4. Mask Processing: Manipulating and refining segmentation masks.
5. Utility Functions: Supporting operations for image analysis and segmentation tasks.
