Brieflow is tool written with [Snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io) that simplifies and automates many of the steps in optical pooled screen (OPS) analysis.
Although written to be easily deployed on a Slurm cluster, it can also be run on other cloud-based or local systems.
We have built Brieflow in tandem with [brieflow-analysis](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis) to configure and organize Brieflow runs.

Brieflow currently automates the following OPS tasks:

- **Preprocessing**: Converts raw microscope `.nd2` files into tiled `.tiff` or `.zarr` images and extracts associated metadata (e.g. cycle, tile, well).
- **SBS**: Identifies and decodes in situ sequencing barcodes from fluorescence imaging data.
- **Phenotype**: Extracts morphological and intensity-based features for each cell from the imaging data.
- **Merge**: Matches phenotypic features with decoded barcodes across cycles and imaging rounds.
- **Aggregate**: Aggregates single-cell data by perturbation or barcode, producing summary-level datasets.
- **Cluster**: Performs unsupervised clustering to identify patterns or phenotypic signatures across perturbations.

Brieflow supports both TIFF and Zarr formats, with Zarr offering improved performance for large datasets and native support for visualization in Napari. See the [Zarr Support](zarr_support.md) page for details.

We recommend you view the doc pages below (in order) before using brieflow/brieflow-analysis to ensure you have a good understanding of the system.

Brieflow is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the tool :)
